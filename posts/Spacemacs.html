      <h1>Spacemacs</h1>

      <p>Actually I wanted to write about mu4e and some other tools that are required in order to read email right in your emacs, but turned out that this subject is a bit hard to write about, so while the work on that tutorial / post is in progress, I decided to write few words about Spacemacs - a great starter kit for Emacs that I was using for the last two weeks. But to be fair - I am not using it anymore. Why - read further!</p>

<h1 id="sec-1">Intro</h1>
<p>Time to time I am looking for something new to try in Emacs. Actually, almost always I find something really exciting. Something I want to give a try as soon as possible. So when I found someone mentioning Spacemacs on the internet I followed the link to Spacemacs repository on github. I checked it’s description and thought that this is the thing I should install and use. And so I did.</p>
<p>Spacemacs is trying to bring best from emacs and vim to one editor – emacs. That’s great, but honestly, I never liked vim (probably because I never truly used it). But the authors of this project assured me that it’s OK if I never will use the ‘vim’ part. So basically from my point of view, spacemacs is a beefed version of emacs. I remember trying <code>Prelude</code> project just to see a big and complicated starter pack. I don’t have anything against <code>Prelude</code> but for me it was too hard and too restrictive. Plus a bit slow. So when I saw Spacemacs I thought that I should try it, but I did it without any big expectations.</p>
<h1 id="sec-2">First impression</h1>
<p>My first impression after I installed it (without any problems, I must admit) was just ‘WOW!’. Things that I found incredibly great about Spacemacs are:</p>
<ul>
<li>fast startup</li>
<li>lazy loading of heavy packages</li>
<li>just a lot of things that work as a clock together because of good configurations</li>
<li>and again - great configurations</li>
<li>great idea of layers</li>
<li>it’s very easy to extend configurations or even dramatically change them</li>
<li>great community</li>
</ul>
<p>I never tried a lot if things before I used Spacemacs. For example, I was amazed on how fast the startup time is. Then I found that it’s because of <code>use-package</code> macro (big thanks to author). Also I never tried <code>helm</code>. Still can’t say that I really like it, but it was a great experience to see it greatly configured and use it for a bit. Also I found so much cool configurations and key bindings that I was really shocked and ashamed that I never had such configurations and consistent key bindings. I’ve found some new things about org mode (indentation mode, fancy bullets and some other modes). Also I found some great configurations for emacs-lisp mode, company-mode, csharp/omnisharp. I tried some great configurations for editing xml files, python sources. I found myself switching files and projects very fast because of recentf, projectile and sometimes of some ag magic. So I need to say that I learned very much new things about Emacs from Spacemacs. It was a good boost for me.</p>
<h1 id="sec-3">So why abandon it?</h1>
<p>It’s the same as with <code>oh-my-zsh</code>. It might be very cool. But firstly, it’s not you who makes decisions and changes. And secondly, it has so much stuff you never need. I find it much more pleasant to improve my own configurations. It gives me much more space for experimenting.</p>
<p>But I found a lot of great things in sources of Spacemacs. So now I am just improving my own configurations by stealing from Spacemacs some good ideas and lines of code (sorry).</p>
<h1 id="sec-4">And what about the Evil part?</h1>
<p>Sorry, but I haven’t used it very much. As I said, I am not the ‘vim’ guy. It just doesn’t work for me (at least now). But I keep hearing from vi users that they like Spacemacs very much. So if you are a vi or evil user - you should try it as well.</p>
