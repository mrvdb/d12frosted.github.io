Well. I am pretty sure that I wanted to write about ~GHC.Generics~ and how you can simplify your life by using them. Yeah, that was a great idea for the very first blog post. It's kinda advanced and not about monads, cause every one already knows, that monads are burritos (oops, have I said that out loud?).

But you know, someone already solved my problem that was forcing me to that genero-sutra. So I am just posting pretty cool "Hello World" example.

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
main :: IO ()
main = putStrLn "Hello World!"
#+END_SRC

Fascinating, isn't it? No? Oh then you should know, that while I was playing with travis configurations my github password accidentally leaked out to the open world. Funny, but that was another "Hello World" example. A good one, for sure.

Have a nice morning and don't forget to make your life happier.
