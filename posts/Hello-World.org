Well. I am pretty sure that I wanted to write about ~GHC.Generics~ and it can
simplify our life. Yeah, that was a great idea for the very first blog post.
It's kind of advanced and not about monads, cause every one already knows, that
monads are just burritos (oops, have I said that out loud?).

But you see, someone already solved the problem I was solving using
~GHC.Generics~, so I had to change my plans. So here is yet another great "Hello
World" example.

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
main :: IO ()
main = putStrLn "Hello World!"
#+END_SRC

Fascinating, isn't it? No? Oh then you should know, that while I was playing
with travis configurations my GitHub password was accidentally leaked. Funny,
but that was another "Hello World" example. A good one, for sure.

Have a nice morning and don't forget to make your life happier.
