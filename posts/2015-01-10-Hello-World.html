    <h1>Hello World</h1>

<p>Well. I am pretty sure that I wanted to write about <code>GHC.Generics</code> and how you can simplify your life by using them. Yeah, that was a great idea for the very first blog post. It’s kinda advanced and not about monads, cause every one already knows, that monads are burritos (oops, have I said that out loud?).</p>
<p>But you know, someone already solved my problem that was forcing me to that genero-sutra. So I am just posting pretty cool “Hello World” example.</p>
<pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span class="ot">main ::</span> <span class="dt">IO</span> ()
main <span class="fu">=</span> putStrLn <span class="st">&quot;Hello World!&quot;</span></code></pre>
<p>Fascinating, isn’t it? No? Oh then you should know, that while I was playing with travis configurations my github password accidently leaked out to the open world. Funny, but that was another “Hello World” example. A good one, for sure.</p>
<p>Have a nice morning and don’t forget to make your life happier.</p>
