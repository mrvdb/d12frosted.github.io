    <h1>The monkey among us</h1>

<p>
  As far as I know, it is a good practice to introduce yourself at the very first page of your personal site. First of all, it is a good way to get rid of all this empty space. And second, in most cases people don't bother themselves with reading this stuff, so I can write here wherever I wish (even claim that I hate dwarfs and no one will bat an eye). I know, I could just use well-known lorem ipsum generator and fill the whole page with it's output. But you know, I don't believe in lorem ipsum anymore.

  So few words about myself. Ehem... Most likely you have heard about typing monkeys thought experiment. Why? Well, I like to think about myself as one of those monkeys. I like hitting random keys, I like being happy. Sometimes I produce programs, but I prefer bananas (with milk and cacao).
